To implement the program
In terminal, use g++ -std=c++11 and put .cpp file after.
For example, g++ -std=c++11 main_item.cpp is to run the code in main_item.cpp in the compiler.
After passing the compiler check, put ./a.out to generate the result.

Additional instruction
Need to manually change the test filename and result filename since the program only deal with one test file each time.
Need to delete everything in the result file before compiling the program.
Main_cos_up.cpp: user base cosine similarity with smoothing and case modification. Main_cos.cpp: use base cosine similarity.
Main_item.cpp: item base.
Main_pea_case.cpp: user base pearson correlation with case modification. Main_pea_iuf.cpp: user base pearson correlation with iuf.
Own_alg.cpp: my own algrithm. Main_pea.cpp: user base pearson correlation.
